You will also need the email address of whoever you want to send the email to. Email addresses serve a similar function to physical addresses: they specify where an email came from and where it should go.</p> <p>An email address is a sequence of characters with two sections separated by an @ symbol. Here are some examples of emails:</p> <ul> <li>Kristian.Bogan@gmail.com</li> <li>Scot29@outlook.com</li> <li>ilovedogs123@yahoo.com</li> </ul> <p>The second part of an email address that comes after the @ symbol is called the domain. The domain is often the name of the company who provides the email service to that address. Some common email domains are gmail.com, yahoo.com, and outlook.com. The first section of an email address that comes before the @ symbol is a sequence of letters and numbers that you usually get to choose. It's a good idea to choose a combination of your first and last name if you'll be using the email for professional purposes, such as job applications. A person named John Smith could have could have any of the following emails, for instance:</p> <ul> <li>johnsmith@gmail.com</li> <li>johnsmith32@outlook.com</li> <li>jdsmith@yahoo.com</li> </ul> <p>Creating an email address with companies such as Gmail or Outlook is free! To do this, you can search something like \u201ccreate a new Gmail account\u201d on the internet. This search will find web pages with instructions to walk you through setting up your email address.</p> <p>If you are a student or an employee of a company, your organization will often assign you an email address. The email address will usually have the organization's name in its domain name. For instance, a student at the University of British Columbia might have the email address johnsmith@student.ubc.ca. An employee of XYZ Corporation might have the email address johnsmith@xyz.com.</p> <p>It is normal for one person to have more than one email address. These addresses can serve different purposes, some personal and some professional. You can use a personal email address for whatever you\u2019d like, but professional email addresses should only be used for professional communication. For instance, an email address created for you by your employer should only be used for doing your work. This could include sending emails to your colleagues, business partners, and other work-related contacts.</p> <p>Once you have an email address, other people can send you emails to this address. Emails sent to your address will arrive in your email inbox.</p>"},{"location":"course/1-communication/1.1-email.html#email-inbox","title":"Email Inbox","text":"<p>Your email inbox is where emails that are sent to you will arrive. This is similar to how physical mail is delivered to your mailbox. Below is an example Gmail inbox. The main part of the inbox is organized like a grid, with each row being a different email. For each email, you can see who sent it, the subject (a summary of the email written by the sender), and the date/time it was received.</p> <p>If you click on any one of the emails in your inbox, the full email will be displayed so that you can read its contents. If you would like to send a new email, you can click the \u201c+ Compose\u201d button in the top left corner.</p> <p>On the left-hand side there is a list of folders where you can find particular categories of emails. For instance, the sent folder is where you can find the emails you have sent. The drafts folder is where you will find emails you have drafted but not yet sent. The spam or junk folder is where emails that are suspected to be junk mail will get sent. You should check this folder if you haven\u2019t received an email you are expecting, because sometimes emails are mistakenly labeled as junk.

The \u2018Bcc\u2019 field (which stands for blind carbon copy) is for interested parties whose email address should not be shown to other recipients of the email.</p> <p>For instance, you could put your manager\u2019s email address in the Cc field of an important work email so that they know you\u2019ve sent it. You could word this as \u2018copying\u2019 your manager on the email. Another example is if you were sending an email to hundreds of customers, you would want to put them in the Bcc field.

Many of these words you are likely familiar with, but they can mean different things in the world of social media.</p> <p><code>Platform:</code> Social media websites and apps are collectively called social media platforms. Example sentence: \u201cFacebook is my favorite social media platform.\u201d</p> <p><code>Post:</code> To post something to social media means to share it on the platform for other people to see. The thing you have shared is also called a post. Example sentences: \u201cIs this photo good enough to post on social media?\u201d \u201cI deleted all my posts with my ex since we aren\u2019t together anymore.\u201d</p> <p><code>Content:</code> A user\u2019s content is a catch-all term for the photos, videos, audio, and text that they share on social media. Example sentence: \u201cThe content that this artist posts is so creative.\u201d</p> <p><code>Profile:</code> On almost any social media platform, you will create a \u2018profile\u2019 which is a page of information that represents you, like your name and photo. This is an online representation of who you are. It is best to avoid sharing a lot of personal information about yourself, especially if your profile is publicly available for anyone to see. You can leave optional sections blank, such as your birthday. You can also use a photo that isn\u2019t your real face, such as a photo of your pet. Example sentence: \u201cI didn\u2019t put my last name in my profile because I don\u2019t want strangers to be able to see it.\u201d</p> <p><code>Bio:</code> Most social media platforms have a \u2018bio\u2019 profile section where users can write a brief description of themselves. This could include their name, interests, a quote they like, links to other websites, or anything else they choose to include. Example sentence: \u201cThis person is probably in university because it says UBC in their bio.\u201d</p> <p><code>Follower/to follow:</code> \u2018Following\u2019 another user means clicking the \u2018follow\u2019 button on their profile. When you do this, the content that they post will be regularly shown to you. Example sentence: \u201cI started using social media very recently, so I don\u2019t have very many followers.\u201d \u201cI follow all my favorite celebrities but none of them have followed me back.\u201d</p> <p><code>Subscriber/to subscribe:</code> On some platforms, the words \u2018subscriber\u2019 and \u2018to subscribe\u2019 are used in place of \u2018follower\u2019 and \u2018to follow.\u2019 They also mean a similar thing. When you subscribe to an account, you will be shown content that they post. Example sentences: \u201cThis person said something controversial so they\u2019re losing a lot of subscribers.\u201d \u201cIf you like my videos, you should subscribe to see more of them!\u201d</p> <p><code>Like:</code> To like a post means to click the \u2018like\u2019 button on the post to show that you feel positively about it. Often this button is a heart icon or a thumbs up icon. The \u2018like\u2019 feature is available on most social media platforms. The number of likes a post has gotten refers to the number of people who have pressed the like button. Example sentences: \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed because I was looking through John\u2019s old posts and accidentally liked a photo from three years ago - now he might think I'm obsessed with him!\" \u201cThis photo didn\u2019t get a lot of likes but I don\u2019t care because I think it\u2019s a great one\u201d</p> <p><code>Feed:</code> A feed is a stream of images, text, links, or whatever content is used on a particular platform. It is generally personalized by an algorithm (a sequence of steps executed by a computer) based on which accounts you follow or what content you have interacted with. Every time you open the app or website, your feed will be updated with new content to look at. Example sentence: \u201cYour Facebook feed looks nothing like mine. Yours is full of cooking videos, and mine is all photos of cats. We must follow very different people.\u201d</p> <p><code>Livestream:</code> A livestream is a live video of a user that other users can watch, like live TV but on social media. Not all social media platforms have this feature, but many of the video-based ones do. Example sentence: \u201cMy favourite singer is having a livestream tonight to preview their new album.\u201d</p> <p><code>Meme:</code> A meme is a photo or video, sometimes with text over top, that is funny and is spread to many people over the internet. Memes are not exclusive to social media, but social media is often how they are spread. Example sentence: \u201cYou should follow this account \u2013 they post the best memes.\u201d</p> See some examples of memes <p>  Image source: <code>https://twitter.com/philsadelphia/status/1523354810119979009</code>  Image source: <code>https://www.care.com/c/inspiring-single-mom-memes/</code>  Image source: <code>https://cheezburger.com/5072133/30-priceless-memes-we-can-all-relate-too</code></p>"},{"location":"course/1-communication/1.5-social-media.html#examples-of-social-media-appswebsites","title":"Examples of Social Media Apps/Websites:","text":"<p>Below is a list of some of the most popular social media platforms.
