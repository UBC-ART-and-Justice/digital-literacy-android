The difference was looming in ways that made for a big adjustment into something that I had no experience with; technology.</p> <p>I was in prison for over twenty years. I came out to a world that was run by little devices and day to day tasks that were so far out of my experience, I had nothing to look back upon to draw knowledge from.</p> <p>The first thing I did when I got out was go to get a phone. I ended up silent crying in the mall, as I felt anxious sweat trickle down my back, making me itchy. I put on my \u201cyard attitude\u201d because that's what I\u2019d known for the last 2/3rds of my life: the default brain place for my fear to go. If I was still inside, I\u2019d know exactly what to do. Out in the world, nothing was clear to me.</p> <p>Later that day, the car that picked me up talked to me. It called my mom and her beautiful voice filled the interior of the vehicle. While excited, I was also worried. This was the first experience I'd had with an automated voice beyond the 90s \u201cyour door is ajar.\u201d</p> <p>We went through the city and almost everyone was on their phones. I\u2019d noticed this on some TV shows, but it wasn\u2019t the same. The lady at the 7-11 behind the checkout was looking at her phone, as was everyone in line. What could be so interesting?</p> <p>There was constant continuous noise from people\u2019s phones. The dings and signals and rings and alerts pierced my brain and drew my attention to the point of distraction. It was so foreign. There were checkouts at stores you could operate by yourself without having to stand in line to wait for a clerk to ring you up. There were little children in giraffe headphones standing in line with their mothers holding what I later learned were Tablets in big colourful cases. One of those children was in a stroller. They seemed to know what they were doing and it was creepy looking. Horror movie creepy looking. Later on I bought a Tablet and promptly got motion sickness because the screen moves around a lot.</p> <p>Every ding of my cell phone sounded like an assignment and that first night, I hid it among my towels so as not to hear the commotion. I didn\u2019t know you could turn the thing off or at least silence those notifications. To be honest, the transition was rough. I had to have a computer for my job and then a small army to help me set it up, show me a couple functions and move forward. Many people assumed I knew a little bit about how to use it because most people had either grown along with technology, or grown up completely technology literate. I remember my friend saying \u201cDon\u2019t worry. When I got out, I didn\u2019t know how to send an email\u201d. At that point, I\u2019d never seen an email in real life! I\u2019d only heard my PO say \u201cemail\u201d in regards to my casework and such. But again, no point of reference. I hadn\u2019t even answered a phone for over twenty years, so what did email mean to me?</p> <p>Very few people carried cash. Very few. They used their phones, bank cards, something called \u201cpoints\u201d and email receipts. Again with the email. I didn\u2019t have any ID so I couldn\u2019t get a bank card because I couldn\u2019t open a bank account yet\u2026 and still the tones from all the electronics around me made me flinch. To this day, I rarely have my phone on because the sounds make me jump.</p> <p>I constantly felt embarrassed and stupid and sometimes still do. I can\u2019t figure out how to navigate the program \u201cOutlook\u201d which is an email program. Again with the emails! I use Gmail instead. It's what I learned first.</p> <p>I'm telling you about how stressful this all was (and still is, sometimes), because I also want to tell you that it gets better. This world needs navigating upon release and technology is everywhere, but even though it will feel hard, it will be okay. I was embarrassed to ask for help and didn\u2019t want to \u201clook weak\u201d as my prison mentality was telling me I did. I was worried about the consequences of that. I was worried I\u2019d lose my precious bank card (I did) or someone would steal my info and scam me (that happened too) or just shut down from the lack of info and shame. But I didn\u2019t! I learned enough things to get by and I\u2019m slowly learning other things all the time because now, I\u2019m growing with technology as well!</p> <p>Do you know what else helps? Many people out here know less about technology than I assumed. Some don't like technology because it gives them anxiety and weirdness and others know crazy amounts of information. It\u2019s endlessly fascinating. These Tablets were created with a team of helpers through A.R.T. &amp; Justice, as well as a group of computer science students from Simon Fraser University. The students were volunteers, and I was gifted the task of helping with development of the digital literacy content for these Tablets. Our dream is that people who have very little exposure to technology can learn how to navigate a piece of technology while creating, viewing and learning about beautiful, unique pieces of art and inspirational artist talks. There\u2019s instructional videos to learn new ways of making art and ones to improve or restyle your skill. There are so many options. I was able to test the programs and content that was installed on the Tablet to see if I could use it and make sure it was as accessible as possible. I know that if I had a chance to use a Tablet while inside to pick up some new skills while being able to create art and such, I would want to be able to use it. I want people to be able to follow the manual and gain hands-on knowledge while having an artistic experience. It will make re-entry into the community easier. Bottom line. Oh and, you really can\u2019t mess up the Tablet by pushing the wrong buttons! There will always be a way to get back on track with this device.</p> <p>The Tablet you have is my passion n this life right now. I can help! I\u2019ve been there and am often still there with tech troubles, but I have enough lived experience to know somewhat of what we need to be successful on parole with technology. This Tablet will help with all of that. If I can do this stuff, you can too. Seriously.</p> <p>Enjoy your art, technology and information!</p>"},{"location":"course/test-page-1.html","title":"Test Page 1","text":"<p>Section z.z</p>"},{"location":"course/test-page-1.html#test-page-1","title":"Test Page 1","text":"<p>This is a test page to show what different banner sizes look like.

For example, this document\u2019s font is Calibri. A few other commonly used fonts: Times New Roman, Arial Black, Courier New.</p> <p><code>Cursor:</code> A symbol that looks like a capital \u201cI\u201d, indicates where the next character you type on your screen will appear. You use your mouse, touch screen, touch pad or the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the cursor around on your screen.</p> <p><code>GIF:</code> This is an acronym for graphics interchange format, which is an animated image file. A GIF is used to add images to text in messages and emails. Usually a fun addition and not appropriate for meetings or texts to your boss or other professionals you don\u2019t have a personal relationship with.</p> <p><code>Web Page:</code> A web page is a page of information that you access using the internet. It can include text, images, buttons, videos, and other types of content.</p> <p><code>Link:</code> A hyperlink, or link for short, is a piece of text or a button that you click to lead you to something else. Often this \u2018something else\u2019 is a web page, or a specific section of a web page. Behind the scenes, the link has an address, and clicking it will take you to the web page at that address.</p> <p>Links are often formatted as blue or purple underlined text. Blue links lead to web pages you have not been to before. Purple links lead to web pages you have previously visited. Sometimes links are formatted as buttons like or . These examples don\u2019t actually lead to anything when you click them, so they are not true links. They are just meant to show what links look like visually.</p> <p>Link is also used as an action word. Saying \u201cpage 1 links to page 2\u201d is the same thing as saying \u201cpage 1 contains a link to page 2.\u201d</p> <p><code>Homepage:</code> This is the first page of a website that a user visits after clicking on the link.</p> <p><code>Website:</code> A set of online web pages that are linked by one domain name (an identifying name), usually made by a single person or company. \u201cGo Daddy\u201d is a popular website creation page. If there\u2019s something more current, we can use that as well</p> <p><code>Download and Upload</code>: When you take information on the internet and store it on your device, this is called downloading. For instance, you might download images from a web page so that you can use them in a document you are working on. When you take information from your device and store it on the internet, this is called uploading. For instance, you might upload a document so that you can email it to your boss to read.</p> <p><code>Streaming:</code> A method of getting content on the internet where the data is sent as a continuous stream. This data could be music or a video, and you can watch/listen as it is being sent. This takes up less space on your device than if you downloaded the whole song/video and then watched it.</p> <p><code>App:</code> Apps are computer programs on a device that serve a specific purpose. If your device was a toolbelt, then the apps would be the tools. For instance, if you want to take a picture of something with your device, you would use the camera app on your device. If you want to send your friend a text, you would use the messages app.</p> <p><code>Android/iphone:</code></p> <p><code>Laptop/Macbook (or whatever):</code> A laptop is a small computer that folds flat (the screen folds towards the keyboard). This makes it easy to transport. Macbooks are a type of laptop produced by the company Apple.</p> <p><code>Bot:</code></p> <p><code>Web Server:</code></p> <p><code>Browser:</code> A web browser is a tool that provides you the ability to browse web pages on the internet. There will almost always be a web browser available on any computer, phone, or tablet you are using. Some common examples of web browsers are Google Chrome, Safari, and Microsoft Edge.</p> <p>Using a browser you can: search the internet for information using keywords view web pages and websites \u201cbookmark\u201d web pages you want to go back to look through your \u201chistory\u201d of past web pages you have visited \u2026and much more!</p> <p><code>URL:</code> Every web page or other resource on the internet is given a web address like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puffin. This web address is like a \u201cplace\u201d on the internet that the resource can be retrieved from. When you view a web page on your device, it is called visiting the web page because you are \"going\" to this address, even though you are not physically travelling anywhere.</p> <p><code>Data:</code> Data can mean two different things depending on what it refers to. When referring to computer data, it means information that is either sent or received and processed. When referring to a phone or tablet\u2019s connections, it means the ability for the said phone or tablet to connect to the internet without needing to connect to WiFi.</p> <p><code>Online:</code> When an activity, person, or service is available and goes through the internet or network.</p> <p><code>Internet:</code> An interconnected network of computers and other devices. These devices can send data to each other, which allows for worldwide exchange of information. The internet can be used for many purposes, such as communication, education, and entertainment.</p> <p><code>WiFi:</code> A technology that allows devices to connect to the internet wirelessly. Connecting to Wi-Fi provides access to the internet through radio waves, meaning that the connection is invisible and there are no cords/cables involved.</p> <p><code>Bluetooth:</code> A technology that lets you connect to headphones, speakers, projectors, and other devices without wires. The information is transferred using radio waves, so the connection is invisible.</p> <p><code>Software:</code> Software is a program or set of instructions that tells a computer, phone, or tablet what to do. Software includes individual applications (web browsers, word processors) as well as system software like operating systems (Microsoft Windows), drivers (software that allows operating systems to communicate with hardware like printers), and utilities (tools like anti-virus programs or hard drive defragmenters).</p> <p><code>Bug:</code> A bug represents an error in software coding that prevents a program from working.</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.3-icons.html","title":"1.3 Icons","text":"<p>Unit 1 | Navigating Your Tablet</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.3-icons.html#icons","title":"Icons","text":"<p>WiFi is active:</p> <p>Tablet is charging:</p> <p>Battery has been used up:</p> <p>No audio (silent mode):</p> <p>Volume:</p> <p>Volume can be adjusted using a slider from the dropdown menu or on the side of the tablet.</p> <p>Brightness:</p> <p>Brightness can be adjusted with a pop up slide when this icon is clicked.</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.4-accessibility.html","title":"1.4 Accessibility","text":"<p>Unit 1 | Navigating Your Tablet</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.4-accessibility.html#accessibility","title":"Accessibility","text":""},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.4-accessibility.html#how-to-make-text-bigger-in-settings","title":"How to make text bigger in settings:","text":"<p>settings &gt; ease of access &gt; display &gt; drag the slider, then click apply</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.4-accessibility.html#how-to-make-everything-including-icons-and-text-bigger-in-settings","title":"How to make everything (including icons and text) bigger in settings:","text":"<p>settings &gt; ease of access &gt; display &gt; under \"make everything bigger\", select a magnification percentage</p>"},{"location":"course/1-tablet-navigation/1.4-accessibility.html#how-to-make-the-mouse-pointer-bigger-in-settings","title":"How to make the mouse pointer bigger in settings:","text":"<p>settings &gt; ease of access &gt; mouse pointer &gt; drag the slider to make the pointer bigger</p>"},{"location":"course/2-apps-and-internet/index.html","title":"Unit 2: Apps, Websites, and the Internet","text":"<p>Almot anything you do on a computer, phone, or other device will involve using an app, the internet, or oftentimes both.

It is often used for casual types of conversations such as those between family and friends. Unlike email, texts don\u2019t usually have a formal structure. You don\u2019t even need to use proper punctuation or capitalization! Here are some examples of texting conversations:</p> <p>Images made using <code>https://ifaketextmessage.com/</code></p>"},{"location":"course/5-communication/5.2-texting.html#emojis","title":"Emojis","text":"<p>Emojis are small pictures that you can include in texts to convey emotion and tone.

Isn\u2019t texting enough? Direct messages have a few benefits over texting:</p> <ul> <li>Avoid long-distance charges: Sending texts over a cellular network to people in other countries will often cost you money. This is called long-distance texting. Direct message are a great alternative because sending messages over the internet is usually free.</li> <li>Use any device: Only phones can send texts. Direct messages can be sent by many types of devices such as phones, laptops, and tablets.</li> <li>Avoid exchanging numbers: You need someone's phone number to send them a text, but you don\u2019t always need it to send them an instant/direct message.

Many of these words you are likely familiar with, but they can mean different things in the world of social media.</p> <p><code>Platform:</code> Social media websites and apps are collectively called social media platforms. Example sentence: \u201cFacebook is my favorite social media platform.\u201d</p> <p><code>Post:</code> To post something to social media means to share it on the platform for other people to see. The thing you have shared is also called a post. Example sentences: \u201cIs this photo good enough to post on social media?\u201d \u201cI deleted all my posts with my ex since we aren\u2019t together anymore.\u201d</p> <p><code>Content:</code> A user\u2019s content is a catch-all term for the photos, videos, audio, and text that they share on social media. Example sentence: \u201cThe content that this artist posts is so creative.\u201d</p> <p><code>Profile:</code> On almost any social media platform, you will create a \u2018profile\u2019 which is a page of information that represents you, like your name and photo. This is an online representation of who you are. It is best to avoid sharing a lot of personal information about yourself, especially if your profile is publicly available for anyone to see. You can leave optional sections blank, such as your birthday. You can also use a photo that isn\u2019t your real face, such as a photo of your pet. Example sentence: \u201cI didn\u2019t put my last name in my profile because I don\u2019t want strangers to be able to see it.\u201d</p> <p><code>Bio:</code> Most social media platforms have a \u2018bio\u2019 profile section where users can write a brief description of themselves. This could include their name, interests, a quote they like, links to other websites, or anything else they choose to include. Example sentence: \u201cThis person is probably in university because it says UBC in their bio.\u201d</p> <p><code>Follower/to follow:</code> \u2018Following\u2019 another user means clicking the \u2018follow\u2019 button on their profile. When you do this, the content that they post will be regularly shown to you. Example sentence: \u201cI started using social media very recently, so I don\u2019t have very many followers.\u201d \u201cI follow all my favorite celebrities but none of them have followed me back.\u201d</p> <p><code>Subscriber/to subscribe:</code> On some platforms, the words \u2018subscriber\u2019 and \u2018to subscribe\u2019 are used in place of \u2018follower\u2019 and \u2018to follow.\u2019 They also mean a similar thing. When you subscribe to an account, you will be shown content that they post. Example sentences: \u201cThis person said something controversial so they\u2019re losing a lot of subscribers.\u201d \u201cIf you like my videos, you should subscribe to see more of them!\u201d</p> <p><code>Like:</code> To like a post means to click the \u2018like\u2019 button on the post to show that you feel positively about it. Often this button is a heart icon or a thumbs up icon. The \u2018like\u2019 feature is available on most social media platforms. The number of likes a post has gotten refers to the number of people who have pressed the like button. Example sentences: \u201cI\u2019m so embarrassed because I was looking through John\u2019s old posts and accidentally liked a photo from three years ago - now he might think I'm obsessed with him!\" \u201cThis photo didn\u2019t get a lot of likes but I don\u2019t care because I think it\u2019s a great one\u201d</p> <p><code>Feed:</code> A feed is a stream of images, text, links, or whatever content is used on a particular platform. It is generally personalized by an algorithm (a sequence of steps executed by a computer) based on which accounts you follow or what content you have interacted with. Every time you open the app or website, your feed will be updated with new content to look at. Example sentence: \u201cYour Facebook feed looks nothing like mine. Yours is full of cooking videos, and mine is all photos of cats. We must follow very different people.\u201d</p> <p><code>Livestream:</code> A livestream is a live video of a user that other users can watch, like live TV but on social media. Not all social media platforms have this feature, but many of the video-based ones do. Example sentence: \u201cMy favourite singer is having a livestream tonight to preview their new album.\u201d</p> <p><code>Meme:</code> A meme is a photo or video, sometimes with text over top, that is funny and is spread to many people over the internet. Memes are not exclusive to social media, but social media is often how they are spread. Example sentence: \u201cYou should follow this account \u2013 they post the best memes.\u201d</p> See some examples of memes <p>  Image source: <code>https://twitter.com/philsadelphia/status/1523354810119979009</code>  Image source: <code>https://www.care.com/c/inspiring-single-mom-memes/</code>  Image source: <code>https://cheezburger.com/5072133/30-priceless-memes-we-can-all-relate-too</code></p>"},{"location":"course/5-communication/5.5-social-media.html#examples-of-social-media-appswebsites","title":"Examples of Social Media Apps/Websites:","text":"<p>Below is a list of some of the most popular social media platforms.
